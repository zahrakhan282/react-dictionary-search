I learned so many new  and exciting things by creating this coding project. Ultimately, the goal was to create a fully functional dictionary app that included basic features like the definition, part of speech, synonyms, phonetic spelling, an audio clip and image section. My first step was to create a wireframe on InvisionApp, which you can view [here](https://zahrakhan224337.invisionapp.com/freehand/Untitled-Zlht5rTAq?dsid_h=6ef47684a2308cfea0d05547ab374bf25e580b1f9db89a2dfa3fbc3320f5166d&uid_h=9c5d13a3886cde3be387b73a5c16f7678dc7a4479e5091a82f314e8b304b5d21).

While building this application, I learned how to search for the APIs that were right for getting my desired end result, create specific components, use React Loops and Hooks.

The main challenges of the project was knowing when to create more components, so the application could parse through the different aspects of the complex API and stay true to the Single Responsibility Principle.
